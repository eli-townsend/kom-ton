Design Idea:
	Simple landing screen for rider input information. 

	Input Weight (kg or lbs selector), 30sec 5 10 20 minute powers, FTP, location, 
	and search radius or area. Allow then to search based on their location too?
	
	Calculates power to weight ratio for uphill segments. Power to weight only affected
	mostly by anything over 3% grade (figure out way to sort these, maybe with a flat, 
	uphill, or downhill selection option in the initial input). Then uses other power 
	numbers to compare to segment leaderboards to determine which segments the rider could 
	possibly KOM or trophy on. 
	
	Searches segments in determined area and compares rider data input.
	
	Rider then gets a list of segments that they may be able to KOM or trophy on. 
	
	Future plans....
		-allow them to get a time estimate on segments, but that would require alot 
		more calculation on our end...similar to bikecaclulator.com
		-Allow them to login to Strava and out app be able to access their power	
		curve to autofill the 5 10 20 minute powers...
